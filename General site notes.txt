General site notes:
	chalkboard background? chalkboard text? if the photos have some shadowing underneath, it would for sure help make up for the seamless flow that a plain white background would have. Plus it would be great for invoking the farmer's market vibe. 

	adaptation of that?: fixed chalkboard background, but scrolling bulletin boards with notes pinned on them. but then do the photos just hover? this also might just be too busy.

	another adaptation: hella faded photo of a farmer's market, maybe the one that kelsye will sell at. Hit her up for one. then chalkboard slates with the writing on it, beside bulletin board photos? might also be a bit too busy, but worth a look.

	either way, chalkboard font! - I think this is really important since it will be the main selling point, that it can look good enough to justify the extra concept. 
	photos could also have the simple white border like it's tucked into a page. 

	could even have a little combo of some of the above, the faded photo being the top, with the user scrolling down onto the chalkboard.
